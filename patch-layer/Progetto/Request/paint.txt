Texturing:
- Overlays
- Layers (like in photoshop, with blending and combining. Just let me use the damn texture node stuff in painting.)
- multiple textures at once (bump+paint)
- better brushes (what happened to mypaint brush integration?)
- normal painting
- cavity modulation
- modulation with any custom (GLSL?) shader
- I could go on and on...

Texture Paint:
Paint layers (like MikeW's addon)
preview of a texture brush on the mesh and the ability to rotate it and set the center
Improve texture management. It's horrible not to be able to load a texture as brush directly in paint mode and discard it once you're done.

Texture paint - photoshop (gimp) layers, like mudbox, maxon bodypaint 3D 

Paint Texturing - especially layer support, saving as psd

Texture paint - texure layers, brush size independent of zoom (5px brush is always 5px brush), saving of images/layers when you save the blend file (at the moment you need to save the images separately), brush textures used only as alpha value, straight line painting, eraser tool.

1. More advanced texture painting with layers and stuff like 3dcoat. And with a better performance (it is really slow right now)

Textures / Images: Import multi-layer .xcf or .psd files and use each layer as it's appropriate map i.e. diffuse color / bump / spec. map / etc ... .... Would allow saving ALL parts of a map-set in one file.

Texturing - set realtime texture filtering in viewports eg. turn mip maps on/off

colaboration with GIMP i.e. so blender can use GIMPS filters......
